# FSdiscover - Access your PC via mobile phone

## Overview

**FSdiscover** is a cross-platform remote control and monitoring tool that lets users operate their computer from a mobile phone or another device over a network. I built this project as part of my exploration into remote system control and user accessibility. It solves the problem of physical inaccessibility by enabling real-time mouse and keyboard control, remote typing with a virtual keypad, and lightweight system monitoring. Ideal for developers, sysadmins, or anyone needing hands-on control of their desktop from anywhereâ€”without relying on heavy remote desktop software.

FSdiscover is cross-platform and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It integrates smoothly into your desktop environment and is accessible via a simple command-line interface or desktop launcher.
